This content is captured by our mobile Broadcaster application or 3rd party input software. Antourage is a mobile and web view experience designed for viewing of real-time and near real-time micro-content. Magnetic Widget The entry point for a user is the magnetic button that appears on the host app. Usually hosted on the main screen, however the button can appear in more than one place. This widget can appear in multiple states. \"Resting\" If there are new content, the widget will be in a \u201cresting\u201d state. When a user clicks the widget in its resting state, they are directed to the main menu of the widget. \"LIVE\" When a broadcaster starts streaming a live video, the button changes state and animates. The live video can be seen inside the widget and the \u201cLIVE\u201d tag appears. If a user taps the widget whilst in this state, they are taken directly to the live broadcast. \"NEW\" When there isn\u2019t a live video, but there is unseen content, the widget animates with a \u201cNEW\u201d tag. If a user clicks the widget at this point, they will subsequently see the main menu. The Main Menu The main menu allows the user to navigate through multiple live and new videos. Whilst navigating through the videos, if they stop scolling a video will play without sound. If a user clicks on the comment or poll icon below any video they will be taken directly to the chat or poll within that video so that they can contribute immediately. The main menu can also be customised, by editing the logo in the corner of the screen to surface the organisation or sponsors. The title of the menu can also be customised. Viewing Live Broadcasts The video player can be used in portrait or landscape mode. In both modes, the viewer can watch the broadcast, see and contribute to comments, and see and respond to polls. Viewing On-demand Videos When the user taps on a video, the video begins playing at the beginning, or if this video has already been partially viewed, it will begin playing at the last point the viewer watched. The Antourage Widget keeps track of which videos the user has seen. Each video shows the name of the video, name of the broadcaster, total time, and total view count. Display Name In order to contribute to the comments, a user must have an identity in our system, as well as a Display Name that shows in the comments stream. Since not all host apps require a username, we ask users to create a Display Name the first time they try to chat. If the host app does require users to create a username, we can turn off this feature. Comments Comments are contributed by viewers of the live broadcast only. When a video is being watched later as VOD, these comments may be displayed, but cannot be added to. The broadcaster has the ability to review comments on a video and delete ones that they deem to be unacceptable. Antourage administration also has this ability. Polls Polls are created by the broadcaster, and sent out during a live broadcast. They appear on the screen when they are first pushed out to the audience, and viewers can respond or simply close the poll if they do not want to answer. If they answer, they are shown the results right away, and they can see updated results as they come in. These polls are sponsorable and images can be uploaded from the web application so that they surface on behalf of all broadcasters. This uploaded images can also be clickable and link to web pages for special offers or further sponsor activation. The Curtain The curtain feature is supposed to mimic the purpose of a curtain at the theatre. To serve a business purpose such as sponsor exposure or ticket sales, a curtain be lowered at any time. Alternatively, a user can also use the curtain to hide what they are streaming whilst they prepare simulcasts or perform duties off camera. Multiple curtains can be uploaded at the same time, therefore different messages/sponsors that you can be ready to raise awareness of when ready. Curation Content can only be created by those who have been actively been given access to stream by the administrator of our partner. Furthermore, with this access, broadcasters can only stream to the specific channels that they have been granted access to stream to. Third Party Technology To support our functionality, we use a few third-party services and applications. Firebase: used for push notifications, comments and polls.
